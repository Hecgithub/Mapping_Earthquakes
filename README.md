# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview 
This project aimed to develop an interactive map using the Leaflet.js application programming interface to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. The earthquakes are visually represented by a circle and color, whereas a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and darker color. Additionally, when clicked, each quake will have a popup marker displaying the earthquakeâ€™s magnitude.

To make the map more interactive and informative, tectonic plate data was added using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON to add a layer to the map. The example above shows the tectonic plate that runs through California.

Central earthquake data was also added to the map using d3.json(). As seen above, the earthquakes are color-coded, and a radius is set. When a circle is clicked on, the information about the quake pops up.

Lastly, a third map style was added to the map, whereas by clicking the dark map, different view overlays to bring out the colors of the earthquakes that have been plotted. 

## Summary 
The techniques and tools used for this project can develop unique visualizations to display data. This is a powerful way to show visualizations of pertinent information that can be used for further analysis. The basis coding for this project can be utilized to create other interactive maps.
